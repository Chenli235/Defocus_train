# Defocus_train
run train_model.py to start train the model
model/model.py contains the definition of used model.
model/dataloader contains the different input data structure.
measure_img.m and networkvstrad.m are matlab files for testing traditional methods
network.m are test for using DNN.

a small test dataset is provided and free to download:
